# Webdown-1.2
A simple website downloading tool


## Introduction

> Do you ever build websites and wonder, "How will I get my site back up and running if my initial copy is lost"? Well, we did, and we want you to use the same awesome tool we made for ourselves.

## Installation and operation

> If you made it to this point, you are probably an intelligent humanoid. This is good news. You will need this intelligence to operate the awesome tool we built. 'Any said operator of WebDown must have a basic knowledge of using the command terminal, what a full pathname is, and how to execute a Java file.'

> If you don't know, then follow these basic instructions! First compile the code by typing 'javac onlinebuilder.Webdown.java' in a command prompt or terminal. Then type in 'java onlinebuilder.Webdown'
